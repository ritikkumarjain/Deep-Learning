# Breast Cancer Image Classification

Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most common form of breast cancer. Accurately identifying and categorizing breast cancer subtypes is an important clinical task, and automated methods can be used to save time and reduce error.

## Working Process:

The project divided into two notebooks.(All done in kaggle notebook environment)

1. One(Visualization.ipynb) involves data exploration.
2. Second(Model Building.ipynb) involves making of predictions.

## Models/Architectures: 

ANN, Inceptionv3, ResNet151V2, MobileNetV2.
Even With Overfitting the performances are  MobileNetV2>>ANN>>ResNet151V2>>InceptionV3.

So making prediction on MobileNetV2 and accuracy came out to be 86%
